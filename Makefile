# ondewo-vtsi-client-php - Makefile
#
# The ONDEWO VTSI (Virtual Telephony Server Interface) gRPC client for PHP. The transport surface is
# generated from the .proto definitions of ondewo-vtsi-api by the ondewo-proto-compiler's
# `ondewo-php-proto-compiler` image into src/ (committed - see .gitignore), the only hand-written
# code is the bearer-token auth surface in auth/, and the repository root IS the composer package
# that gets published.
#
# Quick start:
#   make help                    # list every documented target
#   make makefile_chapters       # list the section headers below
#   make update_submodules       # fetch ondewo-vtsi-api + ondewo-proto-compiler
#   make build                   # submodules -> compiler image -> stubs -> version bump
#   make test                    # manifest validation + php -l + stub inventory + PHPUnit
#   make ci                      # exactly what .github/workflows/ci.yml runs (no submodules)
#
# Versioning: ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION (below) is the single source of truth and MUST
# match the ONDEWO VTSI API in major and minor version. `make update_composer_version`
# propagates it into composer.json - never edit that field by hand.
#
# Overriding variables: pass on the command line, e.g. `make build PROTO_COMPILER_IMAGE=...`,
# or export in the environment. Credentials (GITHUB_GH_TOKEN) are only ever read at runtime
# and must never be committed.
# =====================================================================================

# ---------------- BEFORE RELEASE ----------------
# 1 - Update Version Number (ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION below)
# 2 - Update RELEASE.md
# 3 - make build
# -------------- Release Process Steps --------------
# 1 - Get Credentials from devops-accounts repo
# 2 - Create Release Branch and push
# 3 - Create Release Tag and push
# 4 - GitHub Release
# 5 - Packagist Release (the GitHub webhook pulls the new tag - there is no upload step)

#                          the vendored google/ tree out of the ENTRY set, while the image's
#                          dependency resolver still pulls in the google protos that are

# The dev tool chain (PHPUnit + the coverage gate) lives in its OWN composer project under tools/,

#		Build

build: checkout_defined_submodule_versions build_compiler generate_ondewo_protos fix_generated_ownership update_composer_version ## Build the client: submodules -> compiler image -> stubs -> version bump
	@echo "$(GREEN)[SUCCESS]$(NC) ondewo-vtsi-client-php ${ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION} built"

build_compiler: ## Build the ondewo-php-proto-compiler docker image from the submodule
	@echo "$(BLUE)[INFO]$(NC) Building ${PROTO_COMPILER_IMAGE} from ${ONDEWO_PROTO_COMPILER_DIR}/php ..."
	cd ${ONDEWO_PROTO_COMPILER_DIR}/php && sh build.sh
	@echo "$(GREEN)[SUCCESS]$(NC) ${PROTO_COMPILER_IMAGE} built"

# NOTE: no `-it`. It breaks every non-interactive caller (CI, `make release`) with
#	"cannot attach stdin to a TTY-enabled container because stdin is not a terminal".
#	-it belongs only on the `--entrypoint /bin/bash` debug command documented in the README.
# NOTE: input volume AND output volume are both the repository root. The image copies the input
#	volume into an internal temp directory and compiles there, so the mounted input is never
#	mutated; it then writes composer.json, composer.lock, src/ and vendor/ back here, wiping its
#	own src/ and vendor/ first so a renamed or deleted proto leaves no orphaned stub behind.
#	The repository root has to be the input volume because the image reads BOTH the proto root
#	(${ONDEWO_VTSI_API_DIR}) and this package's composer.json from there - it merges
#	that manifest with its own defaults instead of overwriting it.
# NOTE: hand-written PHP belongs in auth/ at the repository root, NEVER in src/. src/ is
#	compiler-owned and wiped on every run; the image adds auth/ to the shipped classmap itself.
generate_ondewo_protos: ## Generate the PHP gRPC client stubs from the .proto definitions into src/

	@echo "$(GREEN)[SUCCESS]$(NC) PHP stubs generated in src/"

# The compiler image writes under /image-data and therefore runs as root (unlike the python
# target, which passes --user), so everything it copies out is root-owned. Non-fatal: a rootless
# or userns-remapped docker daemon already produces user-owned output and needs no sudo at all.

install_dependencies: ## Resolve and install the composer dependencies of the package (needs network)
# composer.json declares autoload.classmap ["src/"], and `composer update` aborts with
#	'Could not scan for classes inside "src/" which does not appear to be a file nor a folder'
#	when the stubs have not been generated yet. An empty src/ is harmless - it is compiler-owned
#	and wiped on the next generation run, and git does not track empty directories.
	@mkdir -p src
	composer update --prefer-dist --no-interaction --no-progress

install_dev_tools: ## Resolve and install PHPUnit + the coverage gate into tools/vendor (needs network)
# No lock file is committed for tools/: it would pin ONE phpunit major, and this repository is
#	tested on php 8.1 (phpunit 10) through 8.4 (phpunit 11) - the constraint has to be re-resolved
#	per interpreter, which is what `update` does and `install` cannot.
	composer update --working-dir=${TOOLS_DIR} --prefer-dist --no-interaction --no-progress

clean: ## Remove the composer artifacts, the dev tools and the generated stubs
	rm -rf vendor composer.lock src ${TOOLS_DIR}/vendor ${TOOLS_DIR}/composer.lock build .phpunit.cache

# target compares src/ against the ondewo-vtsi-api submodule, and CI checks out NO submodules -
# the stubs are committed, so what CI has to prove is that the COMMITTED tree builds and passes
# its tests. tests/Generated/GeneratedCodeTest.php carries the submodule-free half of the same
# assertion (every generated class loads, every descriptor initialises, every expected service
# client exists) and fails - never skips - when src/ is missing.
