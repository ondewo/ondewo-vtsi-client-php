# ondewo-vtsi-client-php - Makefile
#
# The ONDEWO VTSI (Virtual Telephony Server Interface) gRPC client for PHP. The transport surface is
# generated from the .proto definitions of ondewo-vtsi-api by the ondewo-proto-compiler's
# `ondewo-php-proto-compiler` image into src/ (committed - see .gitignore), the only hand-written
# code is the bearer-token auth surface in auth/, and the repository root IS the composer package
# that gets published.
#
# Quick start:
#   make help                    # list every documented target
#   make makefile_chapters       # list the section headers below
#   make update_submodules       # fetch ondewo-vtsi-api + ondewo-proto-compiler
#   make build                   # submodules -> compiler image -> stubs -> version bump
#   make test                    # manifest validation + php -l + stub inventory + PHPUnit
#   make ci                      # exactly what .github/workflows/ci.yml runs (no submodules)
#
# Versioning: ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION (below) is the single source of truth and MUST
# match the ONDEWO VTSI API in major and minor version. `make update_composer_version`
# propagates it into composer.json - never edit that field by hand.
#
# Overriding variables: pass on the command line, e.g. `make build PROTO_COMPILER_IMAGE=...`,
# or export in the environment. Credentials (GITHUB_GH_TOKEN) are only ever read at runtime
# and must never be committed.
# =====================================================================================

# ---------------- BEFORE RELEASE ----------------
# 1 - Update Version Number (ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION below)
# 2 - Update RELEASE.md
# 3 - make build
# -------------- Release Process Steps --------------
# 1 - Get Credentials from devops-accounts repo
# 2 - Create Release Branch and push
# 3 - Create Release Tag and push
# 4 - GitHub Release
# 5 - Packagist Release (`make publish`: there is no upload step - Packagist serves the git tag,
#     so the release only validates the package and pings the update API to have it crawled)

# NOTE: no `-it`. It breaks every non-interactive caller (CI, `make release`) with
#	"cannot attach stdin to a TTY-enabled container because stdin is not a terminal".
#	-it belongs only on the `--entrypoint /bin/bash` debug command documented in the README.
# NOTE: input volume AND output volume are both the repository root. The image copies the input
#	volume into an internal temp directory and compiles there, so the mounted input is never
#	mutated; it then writes composer.json, composer.lock, src/ and vendor/ back here, wiping its
#	own src/ and vendor/ first so a renamed or deleted proto leaves no orphaned stub behind.
#	The repository root has to be the input volume because the image reads BOTH the proto root
#	(${ONDEWO_VTSI_API_DIR}) and this package's composer.json from there - it merges
#	that manifest with its own defaults instead of overwriting it.
# NOTE: hand-written PHP belongs in auth/ at the repository root, NEVER in src/. src/ is
#	compiler-owned and wiped on every run; the image adds auth/ to the shipped classmap itself.

# The compiler image writes under /image-data and therefore runs as root (unlike the python

# composer.json declares autoload.classmap ["src/"], and `composer update` aborts with
#	'Could not scan for classes inside "src/" which does not appear to be a file nor a folder'

#	and wiped on the next generation run, and git does not track empty directories.
	@mkdir -p src
	composer update --prefer-dist --no-interaction --no-progress

install_dev_tools: ## Resolve and install PHPUnit + the coverage gate into tools/vendor (needs network)
# No lock file is committed for tools/: it would pin ONE phpunit major, and this repository is
#	tested on php 8.1 (phpunit 10) through 8.4 (phpunit 11) - the constraint has to be re-resolved
#	per interpreter, which is what `update` does and `install` cannot.

# So --strict can never be run bare here (it exits 1 on a warning). This target runs it anyway and
# fails on any warning that is NOT one of those three - a newly introduced warning is a real
# regression and would otherwise drown in `composer validate`'s output.
# --no-check-lock: composer.lock is deliberately NOT committed here (see .gitignore - this is a
# library, and the compiler image writes a --no-dev lock of its own). CI validates before it ever
# installs, so there is no lock to check; a developer who runs this after `make install_dependencies`
# would otherwise fail on a purely local artifact that is never published.

# reported as "bad credentials" instead of curl's bare exit 22.
#
# THE CREDENTIALS ARE NOT IN THE URL. Packagist's ApiController::findUser() accepts three spellings
# - POST body parameters, ?username=&apiToken= query parameters, and an `Authorization: Bearer
# <username>:<apiToken>` header that takes precedence over the other two - and only the header keeps
# the token out of places that are not ours. The query parameter put it in /proc/<pid>/cmdline,
# which is world-readable, in the shell history of anyone who copied the command, and in the access
# log of every proxy on the way. The POST body is no use here: Symfony reads body parameters out of
# FORM encoding, and the body of this request is the JSON payload above.
#
# The header itself is fed to curl through `--config -` on STDIN rather than a `-H` argument,
# because a -H argument would land in the process table exactly like the query parameter did.
# printf is a shell builtin, so the only command line that ever holds the values is curl's - and

# All three tests used to match on a SUBSTRING, which made each of them lie:
#   * `git branch --all | grep "release/7.1.0"` also matches release/7.1.0-rc1 and
#     release/17.1.0, so an unrelated branch blocks the release. Anchored on both ends now, the
#     way cpp/ and csharp/ spell it: `(^|[ /])release/<escaped version>$$` - `[ /]` so that
#     `remotes/origin/release/7.1.0` still counts, and $(subst .,\.,...) so the dots of the
#     version are literal dots rather than "any character".
#   * `git tag --list | grep "7.1.0"` also matches 7.1.0 as a substring of 17.1.0 and of 7.1.01.
#     `grep -Fx` is a fixed-string, whole-line match: only the tag itself.
#   * Test 3 compared the composer.json LINE against the empty string, so it passed for ANY
#     version the field happened to hold - including the previous release's, which is exactly the
#     mistake it exists to catch. Compare the VALUE to ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION, the way rust/ and
#     java/ do. `test -f` first so a missing manifest reports the version mismatch instead of a
#     sed error.
