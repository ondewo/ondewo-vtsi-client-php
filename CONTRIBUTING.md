# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal
hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property,
  then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a
  corporate CLA.

Contact <office@ondewo.com> to receive the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it.
Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

## Contributing a patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to this repository.
1. The repository owner will respond to your issue promptly.
1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement
   (see above).
1. Fork this repository, develop and test your code changes.
1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style.
1. Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.
1. Submit a pull request.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ondewo/ondewo-vtsi-client-php.git
cd ondewo-vtsi-client-php
make setup_developer_environment_locally
```

That installs the submodules, resolves the composer dependencies and installs the pre-commit hooks. You need
Docker only to regenerate the stubs, PHP >= 8.1 with `ext-grpc` and Composer 2.x for everything else.

## What is generated and what is not

This is the single thing to internalise before touching the repository:

| Path | Owner | Committed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/` | the compiler image | yes — Packagist serves the tagged tree verbatim |
| `composer.json` | you, but **merged** by the compiler on every run | yes |
| `composer.lock`, `vendor/` | composer | no — gitignored |
| `auth/` | you | yes |
| `tests/`, `examples/` | you | yes |
| `ondewo-vtsi-api`, `ondewo-proto-compiler` | their own repositories | as submodule commits |

* `src/` is deleted and rewritten on every `make generate_ondewo_protos`. **Never** put hand-written PHP
  there — put it in `auth/` at the repository root, which the image adds to the shipped classmap itself.
* `composer.json` is merged with the image's default manifest (`require` = image defaults first, your
  constraints second; `autoload.classmap` always gains `src/`). Every other key you write survives untouched.
* Do **not** pin `google/protobuf` or `grpc/grpc` in `require`. The image resolves the library offline from a
  cache it pre-warmed at image-build time, so a pin outside that cache fails the generation run — loudly, by
  design, rather than silently rewriting your dependency.

## Changing the API surface

The stubs are a pure function of two submodule commits. To track a new API version:

1. Bump `ONDEWO_VTSI_API_GIT_BRANCH` (and, for a new compiler release,
   `ONDEWO_PROTO_COMPILER_GIT_BRANCH`) at the top of the `Makefile`.
2. Run `make build`. It checks out the pins, rebuilds the compiler image from the submodule, regenerates the
   stubs and hands the root-owned output back to your user.
3. Run `make test` and commit `src/`, the submodule pointers and the `Makefile` together — a regenerated
   `src/` that does not match the recorded submodule commits is not reproducible.

## Before you open a pull request

```bash
make precommit_hooks_run_all_files
make test
```

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat: …`, `fix(scope): …`,
`docs: …`). Do **not** prepend the JIRA ticket yourself — the `giticket` pre-commit hook reads it from the
branch name (`feature/OND211-1234-short-description`, or a bare `OND211-1234-…`) and prepends `[OND211-1234]`
for you. Writing it by hand produces a duplicated prefix.

## Releasing

Releases are cut from the `Makefile`, never by hand: bump `ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION` (it must match the
ONDEWO VTSI API in major and minor version), add a `RELEASE.md` entry under a
`## Release ONDEWO VTSI PHP Client <version>` heading followed by the `*****` separator the release
notes are sliced on, then run `make ondewo_release`. See the release section of the [README](README.md).
